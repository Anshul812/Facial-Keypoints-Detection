# Facial Keypoint Detection

#In this project, computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures has been used to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. My complete code is able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face; examples of these keypoints are displayed below.

The project has few main parts in three Python notebooks,

__Notebook 1__ : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

__Notebook 2__ : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

__Notebook 3__ : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN
